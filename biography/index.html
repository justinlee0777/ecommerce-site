				Alexa Yang is a soon to be graduating senior attending Coral Springs
				Charter School. Born and raised in Coral Springs, Florida as the second
				daughter of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, Alexa was brought up in
				an environment where persistence and integrity were of utmost
				importance.
			</p>
			<p>
				From an early age, the notion of striving ahead and being extremely
				goal-oriented was ingrained in her. Upon entering Coral Springs Charter
				School in 6th grade, she has always pushed herself to take difficult
				classes and complete her work to the best of her abilities, no matter
				the size or importance of it. With feelings of fulfillment, Alexa is
				proud to say that through her hard efforts, she has diligently been able
				to consistently be on the “A” honor roll and become apart of the top 5%
				of her graduating class, through maintaining a 4.0 unweighted GPA. Not
				only does she value hard work and the determination to succeed
				academically, but she also places pride in other activities that she
				partakes in. Alexa is currently the elected Editor for Key Club, the
				Historian for International Club, and has been a Senator for SGA for 4
				consecutive years. She believes that through these roles, it has enabled
				her to grow as someone who is dependable, creative, a team member, and
				most importantly, a leader.
			</p>
			<p>
				When outside of school, (prior to COVID-19) Alexa volunteered frequently
				at the Coral Springs Art Museum and began to volunteer at the Broward
				Health Center as a way to explore a possible career path. Inspired by
				these experiences, she one day hopes to have a career in the science
				field.
